## Smart building | Energy Savings & Hardware Monitoring ##
This project was developed to enable real-time monitoring of 
hardware and building conditions within corporate environments. 
Its primary aim is to maintain hardware availability and 
optimize indoor temperatures for occupants, potentially reducing 
energy consumption by up to 20% through the predictive modeling 
of space utilization.

The basis for these energy savings lies in the premise that 
workspace usage patterns are predictable enough for a machine 
learning (ML) model. By forecasting the periods of use, climate 
control systems can be adjusted to conserve energy during times 
when the spaces are unoccupied.
