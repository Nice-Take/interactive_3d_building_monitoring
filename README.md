# Smart Building: Energy Savings & Hardware Monitoring

This project was developed to enable real-time monitoring 
of hardware and building conditions within corporate environments. 
Its primary aim is to maintain hardware availability, improve 
physical accessibility for maintenance staff, and optimize indoor 
temperatures for occupants, potentially reducing energy consumption 
by up to 20% through predictive modeling of space utilization.

The theory behind the energy savings lies in the premise that 
workspace usage patterns are perfectly suited for a machine 
learning (ML) model. By forecasting the periods of use, climate 
control systems can be adjusted to conserve energy during times 
when the spaces are unoccupied.
